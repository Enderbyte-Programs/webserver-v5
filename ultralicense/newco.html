    <h1>Create Organization</h1>
    <p>An Organization is the container of all of your products. Whether or not you represent an actual company, you still need to make an organization. Organizations are billed based on products, so you will not need to pay until you create and activate a product.
        <b>Important! </b>
        To avoid name-hogging, if you do not log in as your company for more than 30 days AND you have zero products at all, your organization will be terminated.
