    <p>If you're looking around the Task Manager or in Exporer, you may be wondering, what is WpcMon.exe?</p>
    <h2>Is this file safe?</h2>
    <p style="color: green;"><b>YES, This file is safe if you find it in System32 and it has 1180 KB File Size</b></p>
    <p>However, malicious programs may masquerade as WpcMon.exe to trick you, but this is highly unlikely</p>
    <h2>So, what does it do???</h2>
    <p>WPCMON.exe is the Family Safety controller for Windows. It manages your screen time and locks you out if you exceed it. However, since it is a System application, it is safe. WpcMon starts at startup and runs in the background.</p>
