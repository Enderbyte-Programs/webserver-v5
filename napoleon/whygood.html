        <h1 style="text-align: center;">What made Napoleon such a good general?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>He had a photographic memory, meaning he could generate and read perfect copies of everything he saw.</li>
            <li>He was also a military genius, and could meticulously plan battles down to a small scale.</li>
            <li>He was extremely ambitious and would do anything to secure more power for himself and France.</li>
            <li>He was very charismatic and was able to increase morale in his soldiers through motivational speeches.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Napoleon also used many military strategies during battle to get the victory:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Napoleon never used orthodox methods of attack.</li>
            <li>He prided himself on being lightning-fast to catch enemies off guard.</li>
            <li>Rather than face enemies head on, he would sneak up behind them.</li>
            <li>He would use a figure-8 motion to divide and conquer an opposing army.</li>
        </ul>
