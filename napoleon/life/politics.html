        <ul>
            <li>
                Napoleon drew much of his political philosophy from the Roman Empire.
            </li>
            <li>He greatly admired the Roman Empire and aspired to make France like it.</li>
            <li>He increased civil rights for <b>men</b> and men only.</li>
            <li>He actually rolled back rights for women.</li>
            <li>"<i>Women should stick to knitting</i>" he said sexistly. Indeed, he believed that husbands and fathers should have infinite power over their wives or daughters.</li>
            <li>During his reign as Emperor, he improved the road and school system, and banned nepotism for civil servants.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Where was Napoleon on the Political Spectrum?</h3>
        <p>Napoleon Bonaparte was an authoritarian centrist. He did not express much economic bias, but he was certainly repressive of his critics and dabbled in censorship. However, he could be considered extremely socially conservative due to his "traditionalist" views on the role of women.</p>
