        <ul>
            <li>Napoleon was a skilled propagandist who could easily manipulate the emotions of the people.</li>
            <li>During and after his reign, he commissioned many paintings which glorified him and his actions, making him seem like unto a god in the eyes of the people.</li>
            <li>One such painting was Napoleon In His Study, which propagandized to the people what a hard worker The Emperor was.</li>
        </ul>

        <i>Napoleon In His Study</i>
        <ul>
            <li>When Napoleon Bonaparte invaded other nations, he portrayed himself as a man of peace, liberating them from their cruel oppressors.</li>
            <li>However, the conquered populace soon discovered that they were just swapping one tyrannical government for another. Napoleon was definitely not a man of peace.</li>
            <li>Even nearing his death far away from his former empire, Napoleon continued to write glorious memoirs and autobiographies.</li>
            <li>He truly ensured that he would never be forgotten.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Napoleon and the Slaves</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Napoleon aided slaves organizing a revolt against the British.</li>
            <li>He told the revolution leader Toussaint that he understood the struggle of the Haitian people.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This was partially true, as he had experienced some oppression as a schoolboy.</li>
                <li>However, it was mostly propaganda to get the Haitians to accept French martial law.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>However, Napoleon turned out to be tyrannical on this count too.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Haitians established their own government on constitution.</li>
                <li>Dictator Napoleon did not like this at all, and he sent soldiers to Hispaniola (The island where Haiti is located).</li>
                <li>The country's leaders were imprisoned and Haiti became another French territory.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
