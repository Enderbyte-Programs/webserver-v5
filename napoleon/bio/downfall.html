        <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Downfall of Napoleon</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1808, a rebel force in Spain was organized by Spanish revolutionaries and backed by Britain, France's sworn enemy.</li>
            <li>They fought France using Guerilla tactics, which are very sneaky. The French army was not prepared.</li>
            <li>This caused France to lose some territory in Spain.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Continental System</h2>
        <p>Napoleon devised an economic system to be rolled out to all of France's puppet states. It was called the Continental System. It decreed:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>French Subjects may not trade with Britain</li>
            <li>French Subjects may only purchase goods from fellow French Subjects</li>
            <li>Ships found trading with Britain shall be severely punished</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="/assets/pictures/continental.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;max-height: 300px;"><br>
        <i>Areas affected by the Continental System</i>
        <p>The Continental System was designed to cripple Britain's economy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It did not have the intended effect; smuggling became a common way to trade.</li>
            <li>It also sowed discontent among conquered subjects, who began plotting another war.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Defeat</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Napoleon made his most ambitious move yet in 1812. He invaded Russia.</li>
            <li>He got all the way to Moscow, only to find the city burned.</li>
            <li>He decided to turn back, but was caught in a horrific winter.</li>
            <li>500,000 out of the 600,000 men Napoleon sent were killed.</li>
            <li>Napoleon and his army suffered further losses in Leipzig (now part of Germany).</li>
            <li>Napoleon Bonaparte was so embarrassed by his defeat, that he abdicated.</li>
            <li>He was exiled by his enemies to St. Elba, no longer an emperor.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>St. Elba is a small, impoverished island off the coast of Italy.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>King Louis 18 was instated as King and promptly repealed revolutionary ideals. The French Revolution had come full circle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Life in Exile</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Napoleon was horrified with his situation. He tried to commit suicide by poison, but the poison failed and he only became extremely ill.</li>
            <li>Napoleon remained depressed on his tiny island exile.</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="map" class="map"></div>
        <ul>
            <li>However, not a year after his exile, he plotted escape.</li>
            <li>In 1818, He stole a ship while his British supervisor was off on a trip and sailed back to France.</li>
            <li>When the Coalition puppet government heard of this, an army was sent to stop Napoleon's approach.</li>
            <li>However, when Napoleon first encountered the army, they immediately defected to his side.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A prime reason for this was that the people were becoming angry about the return of the negligent monarchy.</li>
                <li>Though Napoleon forced them into war, he was still better than suffering under feudalism.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Napoleon and his reformed army retook Paris. The Emperor was back.</li>
        </ul>
