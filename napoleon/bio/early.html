        <ul>
            <li>
                Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769.
            </li>
            <li>He was born to Charles and Leitzia Bonaparte.</li>
            <li>Napoleon's mother did not have enough time to run to her room when she went into labour. As a result, Napoleon was born on a living room chair</li>
        </ul>

        <i>The chair where Leitzia Bonaparte gave birth to her son</i>
        <p>Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica. A century before his birth, the island was controlled by Genoa. It briefly gained independence as the Republic of Corsica before it was captured by France the same year Napoleon Bonaparte was born.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Off to School</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Bonaparte family were considered a minor nobility.</li>
            <li>They were the "poor of the rich"</li>

        <i>The social pyramid in France at the time</i>
        <ul>
            <li>However, it was enough to get Napoleon a scholarship at the age of 9</li>
            <li>Napoleon went off to Military School at Brienne in Paris.</li>
            <li>At school, Napoleon was bullied horribly.</li>
            <li>He was harassed for:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>His relatively poor finances</li>
                <li>His Corsican accent</li>
                <li>His comparatively uncouth manners</li>
            </ul>
            <li>At school, Napoleon preferred to read books about great leaders from past empires.</li>
            <li>He believed he was <b>Destined For Greatness.</b></li>
            <li>Though, unlike other narcissists, he would actually achieve it.</li>
