        <h2 style="text-align: center;">EMPEROR Napoleon</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Due to his constant success, Napoleon grew even more egotistical.</li>
            <li>He did something that rendered him a massive hypocrite:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>He did away with the consul system.</li>
                <li>He declared France an empire and crowned himself Emperor.</li>
                <li>He had fought for revolutionary ideals, and was now becoming the very thing he sought to destroy.</li>
                <li>In a move of symbolic overruling, he placed the crown upon his own head, signifying his <b>Absolute Power</b></li>
            </ul>
            <li>English Historian Lord Acton said <b>Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely</b>. This was definitely happening to Napoleon.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Nationalism</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Nationalism is the belief that your country is a <b>Great Country</b></li>
            <li>Chauvinism is a step further: Your country is not just a Great Country, it is the <b>Best Country That Ever Existed</b>
            and is destined to rule the world.</li>
            <li>However, nationalism can also be a bad thing. Here are some other countries that were extremely nationalist:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Nazi Germany</li>
                <li>The United States of America</li>
                <li>Bosnia</li>
                <li>Russia</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Napoleon was an absolute chauvinist and a nationalist.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>In 1807, the French Empire reached its peak. However, things were about to go terribly wrong for the brilliant general.</p>
