        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Napoleon's Rise to Power</h1>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Entrance to the Army</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Despite being berated by his peers, Napoleon proved to be a great student at school.</li>
            <li>Part of this may have had to do with his need to show that even though he was not as rich as the others, he certainly was as smart as them.</li>
            <li>Napoleon Bonaparte chose to become an artillery officer.</li>
            <li>This proved to be a good choice, as artillery officers received some of the best training in France.</li>
        </ul>

        <button class="button" onclick="fire()">Click here to fire the cannon (flashing warning)</button>
        <ul>
            <li>Napoleon was sworn in as an official officer in the French army at the age of 16 years and 5 days.</li>
            <li>He was made the second lieutenant of artillery in a regiment.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, he could not easily be promoted because of his relative lack of heritage nobility.</li>
            <li><b>BUT, that would change come the French Revolution.</b></li>
            <li>Seeing an opportunity to seize power, Napoleon Bonaparte immediately joined the Revolutionary Army.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Promotions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>He scored a major victory against some pro-royalists in Toulon and was promoted to General.</li>

            <li>He continued to quell pro-royalist uprisings around France, even going as far as to fire grapeshot upon an angry crowd in Paris.</li>
            <li>His prowess was not unnoticed; He was soon given control of his own army. This army was to be one of the three that attacked Austria in 1796.</li>
            <li>During his first conquest, he claimed Italy, Switzerland, and Austria and exported revolutionary ideals around Europe.</li>
            <li><b>Unfortunately, Napoleon turned out to be quite tyrannical in addition to narcissistic.</b></li>
            <li>He lied to the conquered people and stole their riches, which were sent back to France.</li>

            <i>Napoleon's conquered territories during his first conquest</i>
            <li>Napoleon was extremely nepotistic during his wars; he gave his friends and family powerful positions in the governments of conquered territories.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Egypt Campaign</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This would be the first time that Napoleon would fail in battle.</li>
            <li>He was sent to Egypt to destabilize British trade with India.</li>
            <li>Beyond a warmongering trip, this would also be an intellectual trip for Napoleon.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>He was fascinated with Ancient Egypt.</li>
                <li>While in Egypt, he discoverd the Rosetta Stone which was instrumental in the deciphering of Hieroglyphics.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>He easily defeated the Egyptian Army, but himself was defeated by the far superior British Navy lead by Admiral Nelson.</li>
            <li>Napoleon admitted failure, abandoned his army, and sailed back to France.</li>
            <li>Despite the overall failure of the campaign, Napoleon spun it into a victory and was received with a hero's welcome.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Political Control</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>After securing so many victories, Napoleon got some power hungry ideas.</li>
            <li>With his army, he staged a coup against the current government.</li>
            <li>He then declared himself First Consul for Life (which meant that he now ruled France).</li>
            <li>Despite this alarming upturn in dictatorial behaviour, he remained popular in France.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The War of the Second Coalition</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This war ran from 1798 to 1802.</li>
            <li>Napoleon, despite being effectively The Supreme Leader, still commanded an army.</li>
            <li>He made an infamous crossing of the Austrian Alps to launch a surprise attack.</li>

            <i>A propaganda painting displaying the majesty of The First Consul</i>
            <li>Overall, this war was an absolute French victory, all thanks to Napoleon.</li>
        </ul>
